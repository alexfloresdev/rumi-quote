        <h1>Intermediate <br>HTML & CSS Skills</h1>
          
        <p>This page is for the purpose of demonstrating intermediate coding skills in HTML & CSS</p>
           
        <h2>Background Project</h2>
        
        <p>This project is for the purpose of using intermediate CSS background skills which I have done with this quote</p>
        

        
        <div class="quote">
            <blockquote>“<span class="important">Delusion</span> is a divine curse that makes someone <span class="things">envious, conceited, malicious,</span> so that he doesn't know the evil he does will strike him back. If he could see his <span class="important">nothingness</span> and his deadly, festering wound, pain would arise from looking within, and that pain would save him.”

                <h3>So far I have used the following skills:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>background
                <ul>
                    <li>image</li>
                    <li>repeat</li>
                    <li>position</li>
                    <li>size</li>
                    <li>origin</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Text-Manipulation
                <ul>
                    <li>font-weight</li>
                    <li>font-style</li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Things I'm learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Even in scratch projects, define the device you want this on, and hint the answer is always mobile first!</li>
            <li>You will never escape that question "what device is this for?"</li>
            <li>Also background pictures with a clear image can distract from the content make your life frustrating as you try to align it just right, so be careful on that</li>
            <li>A great background image is one that looks good on all devices</li>
            <li>A bad background image distracts from the content, causes you to obsess over lining things up perfectly and becomes a sink hole of time</li>
            <li>Skill-Stretch or Skill-Scratch Projects are GREAT so long as your attitude is ...
                <ol>
                    <li>How can I make this meaningful?</li>
                    <li>How can I make this the best it can possibly be?</li>
                </ol>
            
            </li>
        </ul>
